# jeopardy_game
This is a desktop game version of Jeopardy designed in Unity and C#. It was designed for my Professor who loves to play the Jeopardy game with us to test our knowledge learnt at his class. This game was designed with dual screens. One screen is for Professor to set up timer, score and questions, and the other screen is for students who can choose different questions, and answer questions using the game controller. Professor can also load the questions edited in Json style from local disk, and set up different question sets. All the design and animation are same as the TV version.
